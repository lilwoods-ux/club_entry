### OOP(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING)
Objects are standalone entities that have properties and methods

### Why code oop ?
1. Faster and easier to execute
2. Provide a clear structure for the programs
3. Reduces redundancy (repetition)

### Pillars of oop
classes and objects 
1. Classes : are the blueprints of how objects will be created
2. Objects : are a class instance
3. inheritance : a class can inherit props and methods from another class
4. interfaces : contracts between classes
5. Data classes : these are simply classes that hold data i.e. not blueprints
6. Sealed classes: classes that restrict inheritance
7. Singletons : classes with methods to perform common functionalities
